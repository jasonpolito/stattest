At this time, Florida Health Care Plans, VHN and UHC Renew Access cover our services. Keep in mind, that studies have shown that early intervention and preventive measures, such as the addition of exercise and proper nutrition in our daily regime, can correct and/or prevent certain diseases and medical conditions. When we take responsibility for our health, we can reduce stress levels and help our bodies prevent disease.'
