Keep in mind that for every other standard of care therapy, patient interest is not a requisite criterion. For example, a patient referred for a heart catheterization is not expected to have knowledge of catheterization risk and benefits and alternatives. Rather, it is expected that the patient will be educated once he sees the cardiologist. Similarly, in transplant compared to dialysis, interest in transplantation should be appropriately gauged after transplant education has been provided and should not be part of the decision to refer for kidney transplant evaluation."
