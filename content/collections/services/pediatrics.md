First opened in 1999, it was newly renovated and reopened on November 10, 2010. Speediatrics cares for more than 2,000 children each year, including about 300 of those receiving care in the PICU. Speediatrics care extends to the Pediatric Emergency Department located in Halifax Health Medical Center’s Emergency Department, France Tower Ground Level and is also NASCAR-themed.'
