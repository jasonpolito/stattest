The symptoms range from mild to severe. It is not a pleasant experience, but it is not life-threatening. It is triggered by foods that are high in concentrated sugars, dairy and/or high-fat foods. Common symptoms include sweating, nausea, dizziness, tiredness, cramps and diarrhea. These symptoms typically last about 30-90 minutes, depending on what and how much the person has eaten. The symptoms can mimic the flu. You can control this by making changes in what and how you eat. By controlling dumping syndrome, you will also be avoiding the foods that also cause weight gain."

By adding malabsorption, food is delayed in mixing with bile and pancreatic juices that aid in the absorption of nutrients. The result is an early sense of fullness, combined with a sense of satisfaction that reduces the desire to eat.'

                    text: 'According to the American Society for Bariatric Surgery and the National Institutes of Health, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is the current gold standard procedure for weight loss surgery. It is one of the most frequently performed weight loss procedures in the United States. In this procedure, stapling creates a small (15 to 20cc) stomach pouch. The remainder of the stomach is not removed but is completely stapled shut and divided from the stomach pouch. The outlet from this newly formed pouch empties directly into the lower portion of the jejunum, thus bypassing calorie absorption. This is done by dividing the small intestine just beyond the duodenum to bring it up and construct a connection with the newly formed stomach pouch. The other end is connected to the side of the Roux limb of the intestine creating the “Y” shape that gives the technique its name. The length of either segment of the intestine can be increased to produce lower or higher levels of malabsorption.'

The stomach is restricted by stapling and dividing it vertically. About 85 percent or more of the stomach is removed. This part of the procedure is not reversible. The stomach that remains is shaped like a very slim banana and measures from two to four ounces. The nerves to the stomach and the outlet valve (pylorus) remain intact with the idea of preserving the function of the stomach while drastically reducing the volume. Note that there is no intestinal bypass with this procedure, only stomach reduction. The lack of an intestinal bypass avoids potential long-term complications such as marginal ulcers, vitamin deficiencies and intestinal obstructions.'

For this procedure, almost 70% of the stomach is removed, as well as the duodenum.\_ A long portion of your small intestine is rerouted into two pathways.\_ The shorter pathway takes food from the stomach to a common channel. The longer pathway carries bile from the liver to the common channel.\_ The objective is to reduce the amount of time the body has to capture calories and to selectively limit the absorption of fat.\_ The result is that your body will only be able to absorb around 20% of the fat you would normally intake. As with all surgeries, there is a chance for complications, however, the risk is very low and can be detected and treated with routine post-operative care."
