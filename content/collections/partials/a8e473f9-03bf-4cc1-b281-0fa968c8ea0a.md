                    text: 'United States immigration law is very complex and difficult to navigate. A non-citizen desiring to relocate temporarily or permanently to the United States, be it for marriage, asylum, work or for any other reason, should contact an immigration attorney before starting the application processes. A non-citizen in the United States who has been detained or placed in deportation proceedings or who has been previously deported and desires to re-enter the United States, should contact an immigration attorney immediately. In short, a non-citizen wishing to apply for any United States immigration benefit should first consult with an immigration attorney!'
