        text: "Considered an excellent therapy option for individuals with early stages of cancer, this clinically documented radiotherapy delivers a single fraction of low-energy radiation in 20 – 30 minutes during the time of the surgery.\_ Other forms of radiation therapy can require five to six weeks of treatment with various side effects."

        text: "“With this new less-invasive treatment, the small spherical tip of a miniaturized radiation device is inserted into the surgical incision,” says Alvaro Alvarez-Farinetti, Radiation Oncologist at Halifax Health.\_ He explains, “This option significantly reduces the treatment time and allows patients to get back to their lives more quickly. Patients who have been diagnosed with early-stage cancer should speak with their physician about whether IORT is the right treatment for them,” suggests Dr. Alvarez-Farinetti."
