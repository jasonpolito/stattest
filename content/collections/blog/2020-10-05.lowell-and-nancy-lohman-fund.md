        text: "DAYTONA BEACH, FL – (October 2, 2020) – Lowell and Nancy Lohman, local business owners and philanthropists, have made their single largest gift as an endowment to provide diabetes resources for the people of our community.\_ The $4 million endowment is being given to Halifax Health to build the Lohman Diabetes Center of Excellence at Halifax Health Medical Center. Lowell and his brother Victor have had Type 1 diabetes since their early twenties.\_ Lowell and Nancy brought attention to the lack of diabetes education and navigation in the area to Halifax Health’s attention.\_ As Lowell says, “Halifax Health is the 800 pound gorilla in healthcare here (in Volusia County) and we poked the gorilla.”"
