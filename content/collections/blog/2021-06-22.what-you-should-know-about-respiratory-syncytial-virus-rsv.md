        text: 'Recently the CDC issued a health advisory warning of a spike in RSV cases throughout the south, including Florida. “RSV is a very common virus and most children will have RSV once or twice by the age of two,” explained Julie Weinberg, MD, Halifax Health Pediatric Hospitalist – Pediatric Acute Care. “However, over the past 6 – 8 weeks we have seen an increase in RSV cases in our pediatric emergency department.”'

        text: 'Dr. Weinberg also noted the spike in RSV cases are occurring outside of our normal RSV season of Fall/Winter. “Children one year and younger are the most vulnerable to RSV. Most cases start out mild, but by day 3-4-5, breathing can become more difficult and babies don’t have the reserves to be able to fight off the virus,” said Dr. Weinberg.'

        text: 'As in any illness, you should call your child’s doctor whenever you are worried about your child. He or she can best decide with you whether the symptoms and behavior you describe suggest that your child should be seen. In general, doctors prefer to examine ill infants and children in person, as severity may be impossible to determine on the phone.'
