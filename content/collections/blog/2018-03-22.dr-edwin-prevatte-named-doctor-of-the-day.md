        text: " – (March 9, 2018) – On Monday, March 5, Edwin Prevatte, MD, FAAP, director of the Halifax Health Family Medicine Residency Program, served as the Doctor of the Day for the Florida Legislature.\_ The Doctor of the Day program was founded in the 1960s by a former Florida House member, Rep. Walter Sackett, MD, from Miami.\_ He encouraged physicians to serve in Tallahassee each day of the Regular Legislative Session.\_ Physicians who are willing to spend a day in Tallahassee during the session perform an invaluable service by providing healthcare for members of the legislature and legislative employees.\_ Kara Williams, MD, a Halifax Health family medicine resident, assisted Dr. Prevatte with Doctor of the Day duties. Pictured above are Dr. Williams, Rep. Thomas Leek and Dr. Prevatte."
