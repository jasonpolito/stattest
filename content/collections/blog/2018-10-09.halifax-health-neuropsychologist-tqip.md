        text: "This co-authored research project presents a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach to agitation management of persons with severe traumatic brain injury in the critical care setting.\_ Agitation following severe traumatic brain injury is a frequent component of recovery, often characterized by restlessness, impulsivity, excessive movements and repetitive behaviors.\_ The study examined consecutively admitted brain injury patients to Halifax Health’s trauma center over a six-month period.\_ Each patient’s level of agitation was accurately measured throughout their stay in the intensive care unit, and both environmental and drug treatments were used to manage agitation."

        text: "Agitation was treated successfully in these patients, and most importantly, the average length of stay for these patients was significantly reduced to a stay similar to brain injury patients whose recovery was not complicated by agitation.\_ Agitation measurement of the type used in this investigation was a first in the intensive care unit setting, as was the coordinated and deliberate use of specific medications and combination of medications used to treat agitation, tailored to prevent adverse side-effects or delay recovery following brain injury."
