        text: 'Good WLB requires regular refueling and maintenance. That’s where routines and schedules can help, so when unexpected detours (difficulties) happen, you’ve got a properly tuned engine, tires that grip, and a reserve tank of fuel to see you through.'

        text: "Finally, watch for fuel leaks. These can leave a car stranded by the side of the road. In the same way, I’ve seen many bright, talented people with great potential end up on the side of the road in life due to energy drains. I’m referring to unhealthy attitudes, unhealthy mindsets, unhealthy habits, unhealthy relationships, and unhealthy addictions, to name a few.\_ At a minimum, these will steal your joy in life.\_ Worse yet they can keep you from reaching your potential (and destination).\_"
