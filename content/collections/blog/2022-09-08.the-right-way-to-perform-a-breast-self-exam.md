        text: 'Next step, you’ll want to lay down, place a pillow under your right shoulder and raise your right arm above or behind your head. Inspect your right breast with the three middle fingers of your left hand, using a small, circular motion in an up-and-down pattern. Apply different amounts of pressure to each area of the breast. Try not to lift your fingers at any time during the exercise. When you’ve finished, lower your right arm and examine your right armpit. Repeat these steps on the left breast using your right hand. Make sure to check all areas from the armpit to the breastbone and from the collarbone to the bra line.'
