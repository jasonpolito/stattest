        text: "While Jennifer had lost weight on other programs, she hadn’t learned how to keep it off.\_ “This program gave me structure, and I learned how to say “no” to foods that were not healthy for me,” said Jennifer. “HMR doesn’t tell you your goals, you decide how much you want to commit to.\_ My goal was to weigh 180 pounds, and in 13 months I have lost 110 pounds surpassing that goal.”"
