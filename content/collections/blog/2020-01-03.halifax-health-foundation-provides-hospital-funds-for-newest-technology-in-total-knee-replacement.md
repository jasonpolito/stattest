        text: "The Mako Total Knee application is innovative robotic technology that allows surgeons to personalize procedures to each patient.\_ The knee replacement treatment option is designed to relieve the pain caused by joint degeneration due to osteoarthritis.\_ Through CT-based 3D modeling of bone anatomy, surgeons can use the Mako System to create a personalized surgical plan and identify the implant size, orientation and alignment based on each patient’s unique anatomy.\_ The Mako System also enables surgeons to virtually modify the surgical plan intra-operatively and assists the surgeon in executing bone resections.\_ \_\_"

        text: "“Mako is changing the way joint replacement surgeries are performed by providing each patient with a personalized surgical experience based on their specific diagnosis and anatomy,” says Eric Little, director of surgical services for Halifax Health.\_ “Using a virtual 3D model, the Mako System allows surgeons to personalize each patient’s surgical plan preoperatively before entering the operating room.\_ During surgery, the surgeon can validate that plan and make any necessary adjustments, while guiding the robotic-arm to execute that plan,” Little explains."
