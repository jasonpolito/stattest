        text: "- Today, Halifax Health received its first shipment of Moderna Covid-19 vaccines and started vaccinating frontline healthcare workers.\_ 1,800 doses of the vaccine were received across Halifax Health’s three hospital system.\_ The first healthcare workers to receive the vaccination were members of Special Isolation Unit which was set up in March to care for patients who are Covid-19 positive and in need of the highest level of care.\_\_ The vaccinations are optional and will continue until every Team Member desiring the vaccine has had an opportunity to receive it.\_ According to Margaret Crossman, MD and Chief Medical Officer, “Once we have vaccinated our healthcare workers, we intend to receive vaccines designated for community members under state and CDC guidance.”"
