        text: 'Depending on one’s age, the causes of concussion vary. Younger people are at greater risk for concussions from falls, car accidents or sporting activities. For people older than 75, the typical cause is from a fall. In fact, concussions from falls in older adults make up the majority of all reported concussions, and consequently older adults are at greater risk for concussion. Sustaining a concussion can lead to many complications, some life changing while others life threatening.'

        text: 'For children, provide a soft surface to play on, place safety gates as needed to prevent falls, use a car seat, and wear a seat belt properly. For people who play sports, wear a protective helmet. For older adults, this means keeping your living space clutter free, remove furniture with sharp edges, discard throw rugs (as they are a slip hazard), set up night lights to illuminate your walking spaces. For all adults, only drink alcohol in moderation, wear your seat belt while driving, make sure airbags are operational and if you ride motorcycles, wear a helmet.'

        text: 'It is always a good idea to be seen by your doctor if you have a concussion, or for that matter, even if you hit your head, particularly for older adults. Oftentimes, older adults are taking blood thinning medications, and a seemingly benign head injury can evolve into a brain bleed, which is a medical emergency.'
