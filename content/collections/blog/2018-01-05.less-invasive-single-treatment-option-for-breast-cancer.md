        text: "Considered an excellent therapy option for women having breast-conserving surgery, also known as a lumpectomy, this clinically documented radiotherapy delivers a single fraction of radiotherapy in 20-30 minutes during the time of surgical lumpectomy.\_ Other forms of radiation therapy can require five to six weeks of treatment."

        text: "Localizing the radiation inside the breast is effective because this is where cancer is most likely to recur.\_ The international TARGIT research group has been investigating this new method of delivering radiotherapy for breast cancer in which the treatment can be delivered at the time of surgical lumpectomy since 1988.\_ The results of the trial reveal the overall number of recurrences of the breast cancer was very low."

        text: 'Michael Alvarado, M.D., a member of TARGIT-A International Steering Committee and one of the principle investigators at the University of California, San Francisco, says, “Radiotherapy delivered at the time of surgery is an exciting advancement. By delivering radiation intraoperatively, primarily the tumor bed is targeted, therefore patients benefit from less ‘scatter radiation’ to the lungs and heart, and fewer cosmetic problems with the breast.”'
