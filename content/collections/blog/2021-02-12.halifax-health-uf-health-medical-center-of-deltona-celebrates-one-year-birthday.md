        text: "Today the Team Members of the Medical Center of Deltona celebrate the organization’s first birthday.\_ Jeff Feasel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Halifax Health, Dr Margaret Crossman, MD and Chief Medical Officer for Halifax Health and Robert Feezor MD UF Health and Chief of Staff greeted the Team Members with a small recognition ceremony and visited all the departments to share their thanks for the work by all of the Team Members during what has been a very different year.\_ “2020 was definitely different than what we planned for as we built Deltona’s hospital in west Volusia County.\_ If given the choice, we would have liked to have avoided opening this state of the art medical facility during the 21st century pandemic, but I am pleased to say our staff has met the challenge and performed admirably.\_ The amount of care our Team Members have provided is truly impressive,” according to Feasel."
