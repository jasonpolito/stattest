        text: "Dr. Molpus joined Halifax Health in 2005, and was instrumental in bringing the da Vinci® robotic surgical system to Halifax Health. The first surgery using the leading-edge surgical robotics system took place January 12, 2007. The\_da Vinci® S Surgical System is a sophisticated robotic platform designed to enable complex surgery using a minimally invasive approach.\_ The da Vinci® System consists of an ergonomic surgeon’s console, a patient-side cart with four interactive robotic arms, a high-performance vision system and proprietary EndoWrist instruments.\_ Powered by state-of-the-art robotic technology, the da Vinci System is designed to scale, filter and seamlessly translate the surgeon’s hand movements into more precise movements of the EndoWrist instruments."

        text: '“For the patient, a da Vinci procedure can offer all the potential benefits of a minimally invasive procedure, including less pain, less blood loss and less need for blood transfusions” said Dr. Molpus. He added “additionally, the da Vinci System can enable a shorter hospital stay, a quicker recovery and faster return to normal daily activities.”'
