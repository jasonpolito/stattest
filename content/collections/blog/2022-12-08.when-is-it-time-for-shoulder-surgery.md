Often, it starts as a dull ache when performing certain activities like lifting or reaching. When it begins to develop into a more intense pain that is disrupting your normal way of life, it may be time to visit an orthopedic surgeon.'

        text: 'Your rotator cuff is a group of tendons and muscles in your shoulder that helps you lift and rotate your arm and keeps your shoulder joint in place. Yet, sometimes tendons tear, get pinched by the bones around them or even wear and tear over time. The pain can be severe. You can rest the joint, ice the area and take over-the-counter pain relievers which can help ease your pain and swelling while your rotator cuff heals. If further help is needed, physical therapy may restore your shoulder strength.'

        text: 'There are different types of surgery depending on the type of tear you have, the size of the tear or how long you’ve had it. Arthroscopic surgery uses small, thin instruments to repair damage to partially torn tendon edges. Or, it could be putting the totally torn tendon back onto the bone. If the tendons have been torn for too long they may not be able to be repaired. In that case, tendon transfers and shoulder replacements are other options to get your shoulder working again.'
