        text: "“This four-day event is known to be a busy time in the emergency department at our three hospitals, but this year was the busiest year of the last four years with 66 patients admitted with trauma. Having a Level II Trauma Center in Volusia county is a blessing,” said Lindsay Martin, Director of Nursing, Halifax Health – Emergency and Trauma Services. The demographics of patients with trauma showed 48 years old on average with Volusia county residents making up 53% of those patients. “I can’t say enough about the teamwork and commitment of our hospital staff.\_Everyone gears up for this event and is ready to provide the highest level of care in the area to support our community’s special events.\_We work hand in hand with law enforcement and first responders to be there when we are needed,” said Martin. “It’s why we are here.”"
