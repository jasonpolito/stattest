        text: "The Halifax Health Center for Oncology was founded in 1975 by physicians, including Herbert Kerman , MD to provide the most advanced cancer care in Volusia County.\_ The center has grown over the years to be the most advanced, comprehensive and most preferred cancer center in east central Florida, which includes: seven medical oncologists, two radiation oncologists and the only gynecologic oncologist in the area plus the first IntraOperative Radiation Therapy breast cancer treatment, Brain Lab and the Davinci Robot. According to Jeff Feasel, president and chief executive officer, “the Cancer Center for Hope, as it will be called, is a comprehensive cancer center dedicated to a multidisciplinary approach to treating patients and is focused on treating and supporting patients by providing system navigation and many patient support initiatives like survivorship programs, tumor boards, genetic screening, nutrition assistance and more.\_ The Grant’s gift will be used to enhance these wrap around services by creating new positions for a licensed social worker, a multidisciplinary navigator and a colorectal navigator.”\_ As cancer care evolves, the social determinants of health like transportation, food security and mental health have become more important and this is a gift for the whole community to share.”"

It was Chuck’s idea to add “Hope” to the name of the building and program. “As a cancer survivor, I know how important positive attitude and hope are to surviving the disease.\_ I hope the name provides inspiration and positive vibes to the amazing programs in the center.”"
