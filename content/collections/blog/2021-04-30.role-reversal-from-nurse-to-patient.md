        text: "Donna Pinckney worked as an oncology nurse in Daytona Beach for nearly two years when her role as a clinician was quickly reversed. On Dec. 28, 2020, Pinckney was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS. Commonly known as one of the earliest forms of breast cancer, abnormal cells were found inside her breast ducts. A pathology exam revealed that a portion of the cancer had spread to nearby tissue.\_"

        text: "Nearly 20 years prior, Pinckney found out she had atypical ductal hyperplasia in her breast tissue, a precursor to DCIS. With this diagnosis, she knew that she had a 1-in-3 chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime.\_"

        text: 'As a nurse who works with cancer patients, Pinckney was initially concerned that she knew too much to worry herself sick about her diagnosis. The day after learning her results, Pinckney spoke with a breast cancer navigator at an oncology center. Pinckney shared that navigators explain to patients what their next steps should be and guide them through the entire process. She was very thankful for having such a strong support system.'

        text: 'Patients with DCIS can have a lumpectomy or a double mastectomy with or without reconstruction, Pinckney explained. But she did not have a lump and, therefore, a lumpectomy was out of the question. Instead, the cancer was found in a cluster of tiny deposits in her tissues. She knew she wanted to do a double mastectomy, or removal of both breasts, with a reconstruction.'

        text: "On Jan. 26, Pinckney had her first surgery where Prince placed tissue expanders between her pectoral muscles and chest wall. Because the skin has a tenuous blood supply after a mastectomy, it needs time to heal before it is stretched to configure a new shape. It also needs time to drain any excess fluids, and form a pocket that will eventually hold her implant. \_Now, at each weekly follow-up appointment, the area is filled with saline little by little, as her reconstructed breasts begin to take shape."
