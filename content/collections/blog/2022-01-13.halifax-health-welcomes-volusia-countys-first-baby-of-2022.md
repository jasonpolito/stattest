        text: 'At 9:41am on January 1, 2022, Halifax Health welcomed Éowyn Gale Gomez, as Volusia County’s first baby of 2022. The baby girl weighed in at eight pounds, ten ounces. Parents, Ashley Johnson and Phillip Gomez laughed, “We joked about her maybe being a New Year baby, but this was a real surprise”. As with tradition, the family was gifted a basket of baby items put together by Halifax Health and Tanger Outlets, along with a photo package from Baby Face Portraits.'
