This generous gift will not only renovate our lobby but also provide a space where children and adolescents seeking behavioral health services can find solace, inspiration and hope. This collaboration will undoubtedly make a lasting difference in our community.”\_ In addition to the contribution from Jeep Beach, 71 MVP Foundation and NASCAR Craftsman Truck Driver Daniel Dye and his father, local businessman Randy Dye have committed the proceeds from their golf outing each year to go towards the project.\_ Dye has taken his campaign, the Race to Stop Suicide, to all of his racing endeavors in an effort to break the stigma associated with mental health.\_ Daniel has coined the phrase, “it’s okay to not be okay and don’t be afraid to talk about your mental wellbeing.”"
