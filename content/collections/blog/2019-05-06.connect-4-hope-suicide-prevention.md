        text: "“Suicide affects all ages.\_ Nationally, it is the second leading cause of death for people 10-34 years of age, the fourth leading cause among people 35-54 years of age and the eighth leading cause among people between the ages of 55 and 64.\_ Here, in the Volusia-Flagler area, suicide rates are well above the state average.\_ It’s clear we have a serious crisis taking place that we need to address,” explains James Terry, service line administrator for child and adolescent behavioral services at Halifax Health.\_ He adds, “Halifax Health’s Connect 4 Hope initiative will hopefully assist in raising awareness of this crisis and providing our community with the resources necessary to prevent suicide.”"
