The weeklong event held in January is filled with great golf and was once again a success, raising $36,500 for the Halifax Health Chuck and Miki Grant Cancer Center for Hope and the Halifax Health Center for Women and Infant Health. The funds will be used to support new oncology treatment technology and care for over 2,000 new moms and infants this year. \_In golf action Gianna\_Clemente, the nation’s top-ranked junior, shot a final round 75 to finish with an even-par 288, one stroke better than Morgan Ketchum, a freshman at Virginia Tech. Clemente, who shot 69 Friday to carry a two-stroke margin into Saturday’s final, secured the win by tapping in for par on the 18th and a one shot victory."

The Champion also wins a playing position in an Epson Series professional tournament. It takes many people to put this event on and I am extremely proud that we host the tournament each year.”'
