        text: 'Troop 456 began the landscaping and improvement project in February by removing overgrown palms, stumps, and debris from the property. The troop also cleared the landscape of excess pine needles and leveled the terrain. They then installed a new irrigation system and poured and stained a decorative concrete walkway that now connects two other existing walkways. The grounds were then landscaped with colorful small to medium-sized plants to brighten the area. In addition, the troop replaced the older birdfeeders located on the grounds.'

        text: 'Lindsay, an incoming senior at Spruce Creek High School, says he chose this project because of the care his grandmother received while at home under the care of Halifax Health – Hospice prior to her death in 2007. Although he was just seven years old at the time, he remembers how well she was taken care of at home. He says this project was simply a way of showing his gratitude.'
