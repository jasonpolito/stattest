        text: 'Every child who comes to Halifax Health Emergency Department in Daytona Beach, will be seen by a board-certified pediatric specialist – seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. “By redesigning the pediatric unit so that children being seen in the Emergency Department as well as children who are hospitalized, can be cared for on opposite sides of the same unit, means that specially trained pediatric staff can be shared by both units,” said Dr. Steven Viel, Medical Director, Emergency Services. Dr. Viel added “No matter what time of day, or what day of the week your child needs us, we will have a specialized team of doctors and nurses specifically trained in pediatric emergency medicine to care for children. We are here for your family.”'

        text: "Any children in need of emergency care will be brought in through the existing emergency department entrance and assessed by specialized nursing staff to ensure they are safe to be escorted directly to our acute care pediatric unit, the Halifax Health – Betty Jane France Center for Pediatrics, located on the 6th floor of the Fountain Building. \_Children needing immediate care prior to being escorted to the pediatric unit will be taken to a dedicated room in the main emergency department first, where they will be met by both our emergency physician and pediatric team. Children being sent in for admission by their pediatrician or family physician can bypass the main emergency department and go directly to the pediatric unit on the 6th floor."
