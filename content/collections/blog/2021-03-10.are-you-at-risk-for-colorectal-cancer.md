        text: 'March was officially designated as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month in February 2000, by President Bill Clinton. In early 1999, Jay Monahan, NBC News legal analyst and husband of Today anchor, Katie Couric, lost his battle with colon cancer. He was 42 years old. His death helped bring a spotlight to colon cancer, the ‘silent killer’ that was seldom talked about at the time.'

In 2021, an estimated 149,500 people in the US will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer. When caught early (stage one), it’s a very treatable cancer, with a 90% 5-year survival rate, yet only 38% of colorectal cancer is diagnosed at stage one. With routine screenings and healthy living, 68% of colorectal cancers could be prevented.'

        text: 'Knowing your risk factors, and the signs and symptoms can help catch the disease in its earliest stages. Some risk factors, like age, family history and genetics, and personal history of polyps or cancer, are outside of our control. However, there are several risk factors that are within our control: obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Eating a healthy, colorful diet of fruits and vegetables, and having an active lifestyle are things you can do to help lower your risk.'

        text: 'The American Cancer Society recommends screening for adults between the ages of 45–75, but anyone, at any age, can be screened. From 2012 – 2016, there has been an increase in younger people being diagnosed. Colorectal cancers often begin with no symptoms of signs, and by the time you experience symptoms, the disease is typically in later stages. Early detection can save your life – this cancer is very treatable when caught early.'
