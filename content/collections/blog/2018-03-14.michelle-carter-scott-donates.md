        text: " – (March 14, 2018) – Dr. Michelle Carter-Scott remembers when she was a little girl and her mother asked her to take a basket of food and blankets to their neighbor, Mrs. Brown. \_She says that was when she realized people sometimes need help.\_ “I remember Mrs. Brown opening the door to accept the basket and when I peaked in, I saw small cots everywhere.” It turns out Mrs. Brown was taking care of 19 children.\_ “At that moment I realized I needed to help as many people as I could,” Dr. Carter-Scott said, and she has never forgotten that."

        text: "Dr. Carter-Scott went on to graduate from Bethune-Cookman University and become a teacher in the Volusia County School System for 21 years.\_ During that time, her giving back included setting expectations and helping students achieve their highest potential. She tells a story of a young man who ran into her at the mall one day and thanking her for teaching him to type because that skill was very valued in the military as a teletype operator.\_ Dr. Carter-Scott remembers seeing children come to school during the cold months and she would ask them why they weren’t wearing jackets.\_ She learned very quickly that some children didn’t have jackets and she would go to stores after work and buy them jackets. The next day when she presented them to the girls and boys, she was clear that they should wear them, take care of them and keep them clean."
