        text: "The idea came to the Clarks when they saw Lowell and Nancy Lohman’s gift for diabetes and Charles and Miki Grant’s gift for oncology.\_ According to Andy Clark, “seeing the generosity of others prompted me to think what could we do to help people in medical need and or during treatment regimens.\_ The idea of providing therapeutic arts was a natural.”\_ Joe Petrock, Executive Director of the Halifax Health Foundation worked with Julie Roth, Serviceline Administrator for oncology to source a program and coordinator who was trained at UF Health in Gainesville. “It is our hope to start this therapy for oncology patients with musical performance and visual art experiences and for the program to grow and touch all aspects of Halifax Health.\_ This gift by the Clarks takes our care to a higher level not only providing exceptional medical care but also providing wrap around care through comfort for our patients,” said Petrock.\_ Petrock stated that he will continue to raise funds to add to the Arts in Medicine Endowment and thanked the Clarks for improving experiences for so many among us who need medical treatments.\_"
