        text: 'Do you know what your kidneys do? Most people have a broad idea, but kidneys do so much more than just “remove waste.” Your kidneys are the key to keeping your body’s ecosystem in check. Beyond removing waste products, your kidneys balance fluids, help control blood pressure, regulate hormones, keep your bones healthy and help make red blood cells. Pretty important right? So how do 37 million American adults have kidney disease and don’t know it?'

        text: 'While most major organs cause pain or show signs when they’re in distress, the symptoms of kidney failure are often silent and that’s why it’s important to know if you’re at risk. The top risk factors for kidney disease are diabetes and high blood pressure. If you are at risk, you should maintain annual labs and health appointments with your primary care physician, and ask about your kidney function through your lab and urine results. Early detection and treatment of chronic kidney disease are the keys to keeping kidney disease from progressing to kidney failure. When detected early, many kidney diseases can be treated successfully. Controlling diabetes and high blood pressure can help prevent kidney disease or keep it from getting worse.'

        text: 'When people hear end-stage kidney disease, they often think of dialysis as the only treatment; however, people who choose kidney transplant as a treatment double their life expectancy over life expectancy on dialysis. You can qualify for a kidney transplant once your kidney function is at 20% or less, which means you may get a kidney transplant evaluation before you have to start dialysis.'

The majority of kidneys transplanted are though a deceased donor – someone who has elected to be an organ donor and has passed away.\_ The second option is to find a live donor who matches the kidney recipient. This is usually a family member or close friend.\_"
