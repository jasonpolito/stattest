        text: "Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer in men and women, and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S.\_ Most people believe that colorectal cancer is an “old persons” disease.\_ In reality the rates of colorectal cancer are rising in individuals younger than 50.\_ Studies indicate the rise of colorectal cancers in young adults can be attributed to poor diet and sedentary lifestyle. The American Cancer Society now recommends that people with an average risk of colorectal cancer start regular screening at age 45.\_\_\_"

        text: "As a gastrointestinal cancer navigator I am my patient’s biggest cheerleader. I advocate for my patients by providing education to help them understand their diagnosis and treatment options, removing barriers to care, and connecting them to local and national community resources.\_ GI cancers are complicated due to the complex nature of the GI tract and with colorectal cancer on the rise in younger adults, nurse navigators are needed now more than ever.\_"

        text: "During the past 20 years, rates of colorectal cancer fell in people 50 and older, largely because more people are getting\_recommended screening tests. Screenings can prevent colorectal cancer by finding and removing growths, called polyps, in the colon and rectum before they turn into cancer. Screenings can also often find colorectal cancer early, when it’s small, hasn’t spread, and is easier to treat.\_ \_My mother battled and ultimately died from a preventable cancer, and that’s why I’m so passionate about my role as a patient navigator. I don’t want another person to die from a cancer that could have been prevented through early detection.\_\_"

        text: "The ‘gold standard’ for colorectal screening is a colonoscopy. There are other screening methods available that can be done from the comfort of your home. The\_fecal immunochemical test\_(FIT) and multi-target stool DNA test (currently Cologuard is the only FDA approved test) can be done from home. While these tests can be good options, if you receive a positive result a colonoscopy will be needed for further testing."
