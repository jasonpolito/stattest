        text: " If you want great nurses you have to invest in educating them to work in the only largest emergency department and only trauma center in the area. \_Nine Daytona State College Nursing School graduates and One Florida State College Nursing School graduate chose to grow their careers at Halifax Health. \_They came to Halifax Health partially because of the new Emergency Nurse Residency Program.\_ The one year program, the only in the area, features four hours of didactic learning each week taught by physician and nurse subject matter experts. “The education partners with the nurses’ regular shift work and focuses on more advanced training in emergency and trauma care for new emergency department nurses to enhance their skill set,” according to Lindsay Martin, RN, Nurse Manager of Emergency and Trauma Services. \_In addition, the nurses will complete the following certifications; Basic Life Support, Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support, Pediatric Advanced Life Support, National Institute of Health Stroke Training, Trauma Nursing Core Course, Emergency Nursing Pediatric Course, and Certified Emergency Nurse."

        text: "The program was such a success that Halifax Health will be starting a new cohort every six months. \_The education curriculum is designed to prepare the nurses for the Certified Emergency Nursing Exam. \_This first cohort has had a 100% pass rate for their trauma course and will graduate from the program in December 2020.\_The next eight nurse cohort will start their residency this July. The cohorts will run simultaneously to enhance support, training, and teamwork. \_“An Emergency Department is only as good as its nurses, physicians and ancillary staff who are there to provide life saving care 24-7, 365 days a year,” said Stephen Viel, MD and Emergency Services Medical Director."
