        text: "As the area’s only Level III Neonatal ICU, partnerships with organizations such as Mothers’ Milk Bank of Florida are essential. “At Halifax Health this milk saves lives”, explains Ellen Barton, RN and Lactation Consultant at Halifax Health. “Breast milk provides ideal nutrition to all babies, but especially Neonatal ICU babies who are considered medically fragile. It helps build babies’ immune systems and is easier on their digestive systems.”\_"

        text: 'On August, 19th 2021, Halifax Health accepted it’s first donor milk donation from Hannah Knutelski, who knows the importance of breast milk to infants all too well. “My son Fisher is two years old and was admitted to the Halifax Health Neonatal ICU shortly after being born. Having attended the breastfeeding classes at Halifax Health, I knew I was producing exactly the perfect nutrition for my son, and it made my first-time mom brain a little less nervous, but I know not all new moms can do that”. Hannah has been pumping breast milk for two years, donating to friends and family in need. “I’m excited to be able to donate to Mothers’ Milk Bank of Florida through Halifax Health to help more babies in need. It’s an absolute blessing that I’m able to provide any amount of relief to a family during a nerve-wracking time”.'
