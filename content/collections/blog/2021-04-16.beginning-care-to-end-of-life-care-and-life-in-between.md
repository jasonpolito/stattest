        text: 'Hospice is the one area of medicine that still bases our care on patients and their goals. We bring the human touch back to medicine where simple gestures, like time spent educating, listening, and even holding a patient’s hand, can be the best medicine for the body and soul. We have the opportunity to make a true difference every day for our patients and their families. We change the world one family at a time. As families experience the heartbreak of losing a loved one, they are also empowered by the memory of being the advocate for their loved ones and meeting the goals of a peaceful death with dignity.'

        text: 'In my personal life experiences, I was able to see how the death and dying journey was underserved. Honest informed consent for aggressive life prolonging treatment versus compassionate care at the end of life was not explored by the medical teams that cared for my loved ones. If we had the opportunity to choose between life prolonging measures and hospice care, we would have chosen differently.'

I could not imagine another career opportunity with as much job satisfaction as I have experienced since joining the Halifax Health – Hospice team over 10 years ago.'
