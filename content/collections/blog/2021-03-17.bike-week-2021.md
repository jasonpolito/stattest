        text: " Preliminary numbers have been released today regarding the number of trauma patients treated at Halifax Health during the ten days of Bike Week 2021.\_ Total patients during Bike Week experiencing trauma and admitted to Halifax Health numbered 150 in 2021.\_ Of those admissions over the 10 days of Bike Week, 91 of the admitted patients were related to Bike Week.\_ This number compares with an average of 62 admissions over the last 4 years. The trauma team was activated 97 times in the ten day period. Fourteen of the patients were passengers, and just under half of the patients were wearing helmets.\_ According to Lindsay Martin, RN and Director of Nursing, “our community saw an unusual number of total patients needing trauma care during Bike Week.\_ We had more than the usual amount of accidents at home and work places. At one point we had four patients needing trauma care at the same time.”\_ Halifax Health has the only trauma center in Volusia County and Flagler County and partners with the Volusia Sheriff’s Department to provide helicopter transport.\_ “Halifax Health was created to take care of the people of the community and that includes those visiting the community.\_ We have the highest level of care in the area and amazing Team Members who save lives every day,” said Jeff Feasel, Halifax Health President and CEO."
