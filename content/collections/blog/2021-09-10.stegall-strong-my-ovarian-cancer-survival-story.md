        text: "Two and half years ago I got the dreadful news that no one is prepared for, you have cancer.\_ It seemed improbable that as a healthy, 39-year-old I would learn that the very large mass consuming my abdomen would result in an ovarian cancer diagnosis.\_ I was naïve to the vague symptoms that had been plaguing me for months leading up to my diagnosis, and even more oblivious to the dreadful prognosis that trailed my diagnosis.\_"

        text: "As a stage 3C survivor of ovarian cancer, I have been given a 39% chance of surviving 5 years and a mere 20% chance of surviving 10.\_ I struggled tremendously with these statistics the first year in the wake of my diagnosis.\_ I had three young children that needed me and the daily worry consumed me.\_ What if I am not alive to raise my children?\_ In my earlier life I was a college athlete, a competitor, and I would carry that same competitive spirit into this daunting journey.\_ It would be necessary for me to attack this battle with the heart of a champion and a commitment to never giving up."

        text: "During my treatments, I created a mantra for myself that carried me through the most physically, emotionally, and mentally challenging days of my life.\_ Strive. Thrive. Live. Repeat.\_ I have repeated these words countless times the past two years and I strive to live out these words in all that I do. My future is too indefinite, far too elusive for me to focus on.\_Rather my mission and commitment are to winning today!\_ \_\_"

        text: "I want my children to know that their mom is a warrior.\_ They have been my chief motivation throughout my journey.\_ When I was beaten down, at my sickest, bald, and terribly weak my children were my strength, and my faith was my refuge.\_ Additionally, my husband has been my rock and the champion for our family these past couple years.\_ His support has been immeasurable.\_ Equally important was the wonderful support system of our family and friends.\_ I am forever grateful for the love and support of so many and am committed to paying it forward."
