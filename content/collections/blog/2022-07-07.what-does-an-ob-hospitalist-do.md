        text: 'What is an OB hospitalist? If you were to ask the most research savvy parents-to-be there’s a good chance they wouldn’t be able to tell you. But…imagine going into labor unexpectedly. You get to the hospital only to find that the hospital is unable to reach your private OB/GYN or your OB is miles away and can’t get to the hospital in time. It happens more than you think and that’s exactly why it’s imperative that your hospital has OB hospitalists on staff 24/7.'

        text: 'This year marks Halifax Health’s 10 year partnership with the OB Hospitalist Group, the largest dedicated OB hospitalist provider. This partnership allows Halifax Health to have board certified OB/GYNs on site 24/7 to provide care for all expectant mothers. In the event that your physician is not available, the OB hospitalists can examine and evaluate the progress of your labor, review test results and fetal heart rate tracings, stay on top of any problems that may be evolving, and provide you and your baby with a safe delivery, while working closely and communicating with your physician.'
