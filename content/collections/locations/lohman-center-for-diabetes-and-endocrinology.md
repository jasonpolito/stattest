        text: 'Halifax Health offers both inpatient and outpatient diabetes self-management education services. A person with diabetes who is admitted to our hospital may have inpatient diabetes education ordered by their doctor. A registered nurse who specializes in diabetes uses a patient and family-centered approach to teach “survival skills” needed after discharge. Topics such as explaining diabetes, how to properly take diabetes medication, insulin administration, blood sugar monitoring and goals, recognizing the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar and high blood sugar with the proper treatment of these problems, sick day guidelines, nutrition and activity recommendations, preventing complications and resources may be discussed with the patient.'

The diabetes educator works closely with other Team Members, such as social workers and case managers to ensure that a follow-up appointment for diabetes care is scheduled and form partnerships with community-based providers and services to address health and social needs.'
