        text: 'Halifax Health’s Registered Nurse Residency program is a paid residency program designed for Registered Nurses with less than one year of nursing experience. During this program, the graduate nurse will work directly with a unit preceptor for hands-on instruction combined with classroom-style lectures. This collaborative learning approach is designed to provide the knowledge base and skillset needed to successfully transition from the student role into your new role as a professional nurse.'
