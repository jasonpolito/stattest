For example, some insurance companies use a payment methodology known as “UCR” (Usual & Customary Reimbursement) or otherwise known as an “Allowable”. Both of these payment (reimbursement) methodologies are determined by your insurance company and are not a mutually or contractually agreed upon amount of reimbursement between Halifax Health and the insurance carrier. This means that any difference between our total charges and the “UCR” or “Allowable” amount is the responsibility of the patient or guarantor.'
