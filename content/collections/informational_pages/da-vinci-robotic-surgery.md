The da Vinci® system employs two cameras to provide a 3-D color image of the operating field, plus 5 to 10 times magnification for a very precise view. Next to the surgical table is the bedside cart with four arms, three for instruments and one for a camera.'

The da Vinci® system translates the surgeon’s motions into tiny movements and corrects for any hand tremors or extra hand motion. This allows for complex surgeries with small incisions, thus revolutionizing minimally invasive surgery and expanding the types of surgeries that can be performed.'
