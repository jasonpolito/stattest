Admission or Outpatient registration reservations are obtained in advance or on an emergent basis, and patient and registrations are processed. The registration process includes financial counseling, insurance verification and pre-registration. Registration is accomplished through an interview and inputting relevant data into the Hospital’s computer system. Accurate data is essential to the subsequent care and business functions. At the same time, signatures for consent are obtained. Information is provided on Advanced Directive, Patient Rights and Healthcare Surrogate. Patients are encouraged to complete and Advance Directive and Healthcare Surrogate at the time of admission.'

        text: 'Room control provides coordination of patient placement with all units of the hospital to include oncology, surgical, intensive care, cardiac care and medical services. Room assignments are primarily based upon medical need of the patient at the physician’s direction. Optimal use of the available beds will be overriding factor in this decision making process to ensure availability of resources for additional patients, especially those being admitted through the Emergency Department. Close coordination with Patient Services (Nursing) facilitates this objective and provides for the most appropriate match between patient needs and specialty expertise of a clinical nature.'
