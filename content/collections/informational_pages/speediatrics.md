        text: "The Daytona International Speedway is located near the medical center, and NASCAR drivers often come to visit with young patients during Race Week and other events. There are displays of memorabilia from NASCAR drivers and cars, with autographs from the many famous visitors on the Speediatrics Wall of Fame. With the help of the NASCAR Foundation and community partners, we are able to create positive and memorable experiences for the children and families that come to Speediatrics.\_"

        text: "The NASCAR theme is carried throughout all aspects of our 32-bed pediatric unit, even with the ceiling tiles that have the Speediatrics characters on them. First opened in 1999, it was newly renovated and reopened on November 10, 2010. Speediatrics cares for more than 2,000 children each year, including about 300 of those receiving care in the PICU. Speediatrics care extends to the Pediatric Emergency Department located in Halifax Health Medical Center’s Emergency Department, France Tower Ground Level and is also NASCAR-themed.\_"
